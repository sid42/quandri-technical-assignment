# Quandri Technical Assignment - Siddharth Bhattacharjee
Hello, this is my submission for the Quandri Technical Assignment. The solution in this repo 
completes all the steps (1 through 4) listed in the original prompt. I am adding this as an intial 
commit as I would like to add the following functionality to this solution: 
- Error handling
- Multi-threaded crawling
- Reverse index using Elasticsearch
- Dockerize

## Usage
Please clone this repo and and activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate`. This should use the Chrome WebDriver located in the `venv` directory. If that doesn't work, please run `pip install -r requirements.txt` whilst making sure that your machine has a Chrome WebDriver available.
